# Nitro Language Documentation

Nitro is a modern, statically typed compiled language designed for performance and simplicity. It combines familiar
syntax patterns from languages like Rust, Kotlin, and TypeScript with a focus on readable, maintainable code.

## Key Features

- **Static typing** with type inference for better reliability
- **Familiar syntax** inspired by modern programming languages
- **Powerful type system** with generics, options, and traits
- **Built-in collections** no need to reinvent the wheel

## Quick Start

### Hello World

Here's your first Nitro program:

```nitro
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Try Online
